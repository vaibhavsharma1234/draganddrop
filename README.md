# draganddrop
To run and test the solution, follow these steps:

Save the above HTML code into a file with a .html extension (e.g., drag-and-drop.html).
Open the HTML file in a web browser.
You should see the "Drag and Drop Example" heading along with two containers: container 1 with three draggable items and an empty container 2.
You can drag items from container 1 and drop them into container 2.
When an item is dropped into container 2, a success message will be displayed briefly.
To reset the containers, click the "Reset" button at the bottom of the page.
The containers will be restored to their original state, and you can repeat the drag and drop process.
