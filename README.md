# Drag and Drop Example

This is a simple web page that demonstrates a drag and drop interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to drag items from one container to another.

## Getting Started

To run and test the drag and drop solution, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

3. You should see the "Drag and Drop Example" heading along with two containers: container 1 with three draggable items and an empty container 2.

4. Drag an item from container 1 and drop it into container 2. A success message will be displayed briefly to indicate that the drop was successful.

5. To reset the containers to their original state, click the "Reset" button at the bottom of the page.

## Customization

You can customize the drag and drop example by modifying the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in the `index.html` file.

- To change the items in container 1, modify the HTML code inside the `container1` div element.

- You can update the styles in the `<style>` section of the HTML file to customize the appearance of the containers, items, and other elements.

- If you need to modify the functionality or behavior of the drag and drop feature, you can make changes to the JavaScript code in the `<script>` section of the HTML file.

## Compatibility

The drag and drop example should work in modern web browsers that support HTML5 drag and drop API, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
